PAIR TRADING USING CLUSTERING
Pairs trading is a non-directional, relative value investment strategy that seeks to identify 2 companies or funds with similar characteristics whose equity securities are currently trading at a price relationship that is out of their historical trading range. This investment strategy will entail buying the undervalued security while short-selling the overvalued security, all while maintaining market neutrality.
Pairs trading refers to trading a discrepancy in the correlation of two underlyings. For example, if XYZ is positively correlated to ZYX, and one is up 10 points while the other is down 10 points, we can assume that they will revert back to their positive correlation. There are many pairs out there, but we have a few guidelines we like to stick to.
Trade example: /ES and /NQ are highly correlated stock index futures. If there was a situation where /ES was up 1% but /NQ was flat, we might look to sell /ES while buying /NQ. The assumption in this trade is that the correlation breakdown between the pair is temporary and the movements would normalize.
